# CoGent

CoGent is a Python tool for generating contracts from a given register automaton (RA) for a method. The automaton represents the input-output behavior of the method of interest. We assume the method is a part of a library consisting of methods for managing an object (e.g., list, stack, queue, etc.). We call the methods that modify the object state *modifiers* and the methods that query the object state *observers*. The latter methods do not modify the object state. The given RA shall capture such behavior for all the methods in the library, and the tool CoGent then generates a set of contracts for any given *modifier*. 

## Installation
1. Create or select a directory, say *myfolder*
2. Enter into the directory *myfolder*
3. Download the CoGent code into *myfolder*
   1. Download the code as a compressed zip or tar file
      1. Unzip or Untar the file 
   2. Clone the repository using *git* command

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/sandipghosal/CoGent.git
```
Find an example of XML file inside the folder *input*

## Usage

The tool accepts the following inputs:
1. The register automaton as an XML file, say *input.xml*
2. The name of the method of interest, say *target*

Next, the contract for *target* can be generated by issuing the following command:

```pythonxw
python main.py -i <input.xml> -t <target>

```
See the list of all the switches available for the tool:

```pythonxw
python main.py -h

```
